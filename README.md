This is a simple job listing app I built while following along with a MERN tutorial.
I went through the entire process and hand-coded every line, so as to gain full understanding.
I'm not presenting this as my own original concept, but as a sample of work I have completed using the MERN stack.
I intend to continue on my path of learning, and produce more work here in the future.

If you're considering me for a position, and you'd like to discuss my understanding of anything within this project, or offer any contructive feedback, please feel free to contact me at yesanded@gmail.com.
